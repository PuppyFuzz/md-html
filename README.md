We all know that GitHub is one of the best places to publish them, but **We need somewhere to** ****experiment**** **with the code**
We don't tamper around with these things publicly, because *there is nowhere to do that without getting judged*
Nobody wants to be judged when experimenting, especially beginners.
Some say that GitHub is not for beginner coders. But why? Everyone was once a beginner and you can't be a pro on first try. So, if  you do get spot-on first try, but you'll need to remember what you did to win.

*We don't judge here. It's against the rules of this respitory.*

Feel free to experiment as much as you like here!
